# [BackOrder Prediction project](https://backorderprediction-production.up.railway.app/)




The Backorder Prediction system is a Machine Learning based model which helps us to
estimate whether a product can go in backorder or not

An ML-based application that can resolve the problem is proposed to assist in this
case. In order to do so, we tested a number of ML algorithms on the supplied data, and based
on a defined parameter, the algorithm that can fulfill the parameter is chosen and implemented
in the application so that users may make predictions. Additionally, the user may add any new
algorithm that wasn't previously examined and contrast it with current algorithms by changing
the Model Config. If the results are better, the new algorithm is used.
